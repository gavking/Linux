    ## Linux Log Files in CentOS  

All standard log files are located in: /var/log/  

We will list some of the standard system files below, but there are also process specific log files here e.g. 'yum.log' which receives messages
related to software installs or 'httpd' which contains messages from configured websites. You should checkout /var/log/ on a CentOS/RHEL system
to see all the available logs.

**/var/log/boot.log**  
Receives messages related to the boot process.

**/var/log/messages**  
This is the standard system log file and includes messages from all system software and any boot issues not related to the kernel.

**/var/log/dmesg**  
Receives messages from the kernel during system boot process, also about the hardware that is connected to the system including BIOS,
CPU, any PCI devices ... etc. Can be used to monitor when a hotswappable devices such as USB stick is connected to the server. 

**/var/log/secure**  
Receives messages regarding system security e.g. system logins, users escalating to Root, mesages from TCP Wrappers which is used to prevent/allow access based on IP.
Can be ued to investigate suspicious logins.

**/var/log/audit/audit.log**   
Receives messsages from the SELinux system. Contains AVC (access vector cache) messages that notify you when an SELinx policy check has
been performed on a process. This may be useful if you suspect SELinux may be preventing something working. This file can be correlated 
with the "secure" log file to investigate any attempted itrusions. 

**var/log/firewalld**
Receives messages from the firewall.

**var/log/cron**
Receive messages from the Cron job scheduling process

## Monitoring log files in real time  

`tail -f log_file` - will show the last entries in the log file and append any new messages in real time

`dmesg` - outputs and controls messages from the dmesg log file

`sealert` - monitoring and troubleshooting SELinux AVC events

`aureport` - produces summary reports of audit logs - very useful high level reporting
